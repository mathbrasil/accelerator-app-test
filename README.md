## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Starting developing.**

    After cloning the repository, run it in your terminal:

    ```shell
    gatsby develop -H 0.0.0.0

    #with this, you can also access the localhost through mobile
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries).

    Open the project directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
